This is a website I designed from scratch for my final year project in school. I did all the backend programming, while someone else did the front end coding. 

The website is used by a patient to upload his medical information into the database ($pat_db) and by a doctor too to see his/her uploaded patients' medical  information.

Each file will have an introduction
